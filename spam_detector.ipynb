It can select the most informative features and reduce the dimensionality of the data, whereas Logistic Regression may suffer from the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "3. Random Forest helps mitigate overfitting with a complex dataset. The spam detection dataset is a complex dataset. Logistic regression being a single model, will be more prone to overfitting. \n",
